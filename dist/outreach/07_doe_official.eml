Subject: GENESIS RFI - Executable TSV/ENST energy/cost replay artifact (v0.3)

To whom it may concern,

I am submitting an open-source tool for energy-aware HPC policy evaluation in response to GENESIS mission objectives: TSV/ENST (Temporal State Vector / Energy-Normalized System Throughput).

Repository: https://github.com/tsvt1/tsv-enst

## What it does

- Normalizes power/usage telemetry into a unified TSV schema
- Computes ENST (work_units / energy_j) across multi-site HPC
- Replays policies (energy caps, thermal limits) with cost impact
- Outputs delta_cost_usd_per_1e9_work_units for policy comparison

## Reproducibility (< 2 min)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsvt1/tsv-enst
cd tsv-enst && npm install
npm run demo:public
```

All outputs are SHA256 verified. No external downloads required.

## Key result

delta_cost_usd_per_1e9_work_units: $29.27 (with energy_cap_w=2500 policy)

## Relevance to GENESIS

- Executable artifact (no PDFs)
- Deterministic reproducibility (fixed seed 20241215)
- Multi-site HPC comparison framework
- Energy-to-cost translation for policy decisions

The tool is MIT licensed and designed for DOE facility integration.

Best regards
