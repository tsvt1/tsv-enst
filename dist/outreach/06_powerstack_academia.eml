Subject: TSV/ENST v0.3 - Open energy/cost replay tool for PowerStack ecosystem

Prof. Schulz, Dr. Jana,

I am sharing an open-source tool for energy-aware HPC policy evaluation: TSV/ENST (Temporal State Vector / Energy-Normalized System Throughput).

Repository: https://github.com/tsvt1/tsv-enst

## What it does

- Normalizes power/usage telemetry into a unified TSV schema
- Computes ENST (work_units / energy_j) across multi-site HPC
- Replays policies (energy caps, thermal limits) with cost impact
- Outputs delta_cost_usd_per_1e9_work_units for policy comparison

## Quick test (< 2 min)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsvt1/tsv-enst
cd tsv-enst && npm install
npm run demo:public
```

## Key result

delta_cost_usd_per_1e9_work_units: $29.27 (with energy_cap_w=2500 policy)

## Relevance to PowerStack

TSV/ENST implements concepts aligned with HPC PowerStack goals:
- Vendor-neutral telemetry schema
- Policy replay for what-if analysis
- Cost impact quantification

The tool could serve as a lightweight evaluation layer compatible with GEOPM outputs or PowerStack telemetry streams.

Feedback on schema design, potential integration points, or collaboration opportunities would be valuable.

Best regards
