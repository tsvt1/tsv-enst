Subject: TSV/ENST v0.3 - Open energy/cost replay tool (PowerStack/Variorum compatible)

Dr. Patki,

I am sharing an open-source tool for energy-aware HPC policy evaluation that aligns with PowerStack and Variorum concepts: TSV/ENST (Temporal State Vector / Energy-Normalized System Throughput).

Repository: https://github.com/tsvt1/tsv-enst

## What it does

- Normalizes power/usage telemetry into a unified TSV schema
- Computes ENST (work_units / energy_j) across multi-site HPC
- Replays policies (energy caps, thermal limits) with cost impact
- Outputs delta_cost_usd_per_1e9_work_units for policy comparison

## Quick test (< 2 min)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsvt1/tsv-enst
cd tsv-enst && npm install
npm run demo:public
```

## Key result

delta_cost_usd_per_1e9_work_units: $29.27 (with energy_cap_w=2500 policy)

## Why I am reaching out

Your work on Variorum and the ECP Power Steering project directly relates to TSV/ENST goals. The schema could potentially integrate with Variorum's vendor-neutral telemetry model.

Feedback on schema design or potential integration would be valuable.

Best regards
