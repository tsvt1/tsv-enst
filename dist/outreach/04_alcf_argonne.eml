Subject: TSV/ENST v0.3 - Energy/cost replay for power-aware scheduling research

Hello,

I am sharing an open-source tool for energy-aware HPC policy evaluation: TSV/ENST (Temporal State Vector / Energy-Normalized System Throughput).

Repository: https://github.com/tsvt1/tsv-enst

## What it does

- Normalizes power/usage telemetry into a unified TSV schema
- Computes ENST (work_units / energy_j) across multi-site HPC
- Replays policies (energy caps, thermal limits) with cost impact
- Outputs delta_cost_usd_per_1e9_work_units for policy comparison

## Quick test (< 2 min)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsvt1/tsv-enst
cd tsv-enst && npm install
npm run demo:public
```

## Key result

delta_cost_usd_per_1e9_work_units: $29.27 (with energy_cap_w=2500 policy)

## Relevance

ALCF's published work on power-aware scheduling (achieving up to 23-25% energy savings) aligns with TSV/ENST policy replay goals. The tool could complement research on Aurora's energy-efficient operation.

Could you forward this to relevant researchers working on power/energy scheduling?

Best regards
